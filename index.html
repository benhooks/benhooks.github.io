                  <p> My name is Ben Hooks. The purpose of this website is to demonstrate the skills I have <br>
                        learned within the first week of my programming class. This site will become a <br>
                        portfolio for the programs I write throughout the class period. This site is based upon HTML <br>
                        coding. Click on the above links to see further work. </p>
